# Random Password

First tutorial program from __Cocoa Programming for OS X, The Big Nerd Ranch Guide__ by Aaron Hillegass, Adam Preble & Nate Chandler, 5th Edition. 

As written, it's not bad as a first app. It's functional but a bit boring (although I did increase the hard coded password length to 16 - because I'm perverse like that).

We'll have to see if we can make this better (and more useful).
